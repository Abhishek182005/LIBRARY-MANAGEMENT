# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT
It is my first Django project which made use of a database. Django bydefault uses sqlite as its primary database.<br>
although other databases can be used by modifying in the setting section of your main project.
Things included here is database of books, students etc.<br>
It has operation of issue, return and authroisation of students and many more features.<br>
For admin section django admin is the primary where admin can keep an eye on members and stocks of books available.
